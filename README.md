### Machine Learning study project guided by _"Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & Tensorflow" - Aurélien Géron_

So far I've got:
- Classification system using MNIST dataset
- Spam Classifier
- Regression models
- Gradient Descent
- Support Vector Machines
- Decision Trees, Random Forests
- Ensemble Learning
